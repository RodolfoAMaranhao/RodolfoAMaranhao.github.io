### Key takeaways and Conclusion

• Dota 2 is clearly the most sold and played game of Steam, followed by Team Fortress 2 and Unturned.  <br><br>
• When combining Dota 2, Counter-Strike Global Offensive and Team Fortress 2 we have about 41% of the total games played by hour in the dataset. Making these the top 3 games played the longest.  <br><br>
• On average, each gamer will buy about 10 games. <br><br>
• Even though Dota 2 is the best selling game and most played game overall, Sid Meier's Civilization V was the game played the longest by a single gamer.  <br><br>

In summary, Steam possesses several standout best-selling games. Focusing on sales and marketing efforts for these flagship titles has the potential to boost revenue and attract a larger player base. Other gaming companies can learn from the success of these games and aim to replicate some of their strategies, thereby enhancing competitiveness in the gaming industry.
