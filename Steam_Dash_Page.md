### Key takeaways and Conclusion

• Dota 2 is clearly the most sold and played game of Steam, followed by Team Fortress 2 and Unturned.  <br><br>
• When combining Dota 2, Counter-Strike Global Offensive and Team Fortress 2 we have about 41% of the total games played by hour in the dataset. Making these the top 3 games played the longest.  <br><br>
• On average, each gamer will buy about 10 games. <br><br>
• Even though Dota 2 is the best selling game and most played game overall, Sid Meier's Civilization V was the game played the longest by a single gamer.  <br><br>

To conclude, Steam has some clear best-selling games. Making sales and advertising for their main games could increase revenue and bring more gamers to purchase and play such games. Other gaming comnpanies can also try to understand how these games are compelling people to purchase and try to replicate some strategies to make the gaming industry more competitive. For example, the 3 games most played have competitions where the champions win considerable prizes. Additionally, these games are constantly getting updated and release new features constantly.
