## Analyzing the impact of exercise, alcohol consumption and smoking on sleep quality with Tableau and SQL

**Project description:** The goal of this project is to examine the relationship between common habits and sleep quality. By analyzing various factors such as exercise, alcohol consumption, and smoking, we aim to gain insights into how these habits influence the quality of sleep.

Using a combination of Tableau and SQL, we will explore a dataset containing information on individuals' habits, sleep patterns, and related metrics. The dataset will encompass variables such as exercise frequency, alcohol consumption levels, smoking habits, and subjective sleep quality ratings.

### Project Limitations
• The sample size was considerably small, with only 452 participants it is not possible to extrapolate these results to a bigger population.  <br><br>
• It was not clear how sleep efficiency and sleep stages were measured and what kind of device was used (i.e. was it measured by an EEG? or an apple watch?).<br><br>
• There were not enough samples for some outliers (for example, there was only one 9 year old kid, only 7 people exercising 5 days a week, and only 19 people drinking 4oz of alcohol before bed). <br><br>

### Key takeaways and Conclusion

• It seems 1oz of alcohol does not have considerable impact on sleep quality. However, with 2oz we can see a clear spike in light sleep and a decrease in deep sleep, as well as changes in sleep efficiency and awakenings.  <br><br>
• Smokers have a noticeable decrease in sleep efficiency when compared to non-smokers. Non-smokers have much more deep sleep while smokers have more light sleep.  <br><br>
• Exercise appears to dramatically decrease the number of awakenings at night and increase overall sleep quality. Even exercising once or twice a week appears to have a positive impact.  <br><br>
• There was no comparable difference in sleep quality when comparing male vs female participants.  <br><br>
• Caffeine consumption had mixed results. <br><br>

In conclusion, we have data to support common knowleadge. Exercising a few times a week, not smoking and drinking a max of 1oz of alcohol before bed seem to be the best steps for someone that wants to increase their sleep quality.
