### Project Limitations


### Key takeaways and Conclusion

• Popular songs tend to have higher energy, be less explicit and last between 2 to 6 minutes.  <br><br>
• Not necessarily the artist with most followers on Spotify scores higher on Artist Popularity.  <br><br>
• Songs released after the 2000s have a much higher tendency to become popular.  <br><br>
• Artist popularity matters, people view songs as popular if they were made by artists they already know.  <br><br>
• With an accuracy of about 83% our Random Forest was our best performing model. <br><br>

To summarize, we have identified several crucial insights and developed models that are reasonably effective in predicting a song’s level of popularity on Spotify.
We also tested the effectiveness of our models, making sure that they are valid and could provide insights to future projects; furthermore, creating value to artists, companies, and the music industry in general.
